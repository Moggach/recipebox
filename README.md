# Recipebox
Welcome to Recipebox a prototype app for viewing and bookmarking recipes

## Tech stack 
Recipebox uses React, Parcel as a web bundler and Tailwind for CSS

## Running locally
Instructions for running the site locally
1. Clone the repo 
2. Install dependencies by running `npm install`
3. Copy .env.example file by running `cp .env.example .env` and add environment variables 
4. Start the development server by running `npm start`

## Notes
Given more time I'd like to:
- reduce some of the CSS duplication in the code
- improve the styling for the bookmarks overlay on larger screens
- add pagination to the results
- refactor some of the code out of index.tsx file into other components
- add some feedback animations to bookmark buttons
